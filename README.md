## Why Forge?
Let's face it, all of us have been here before. You're going about your day, and suddenly a brilliant idea strikes! Happy that you have come up with your new and exciting idea you carry on with your tasks. Done and dusted, you get back to your laptop to think about the idea and start to try and code it. But no! the details have vanished like smoke in the wind :(

##  Why use Forge?
The solution? Forge! That's right, this is the problem Forge is trying to address. Had a brilliant idea? Quickly spin up a terminal and use Forge to enter in the specifics of your project so that you can get back to it later on. Think of it as your second brain for meticulously storing all your project ideas :)

 Like it's meaning, Forge is a place where you can create and mould your project ideas. Just like a blacksmith shapes and molds hot metal into intricate creations, Forge empowers you to forge your project ideas into reality. It's your workspace, your digital anvil!
